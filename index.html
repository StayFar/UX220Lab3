    <h2>A Walk to Remember</h2>
    <p>It is a movie starring Mandy Moore as Jamie Sullivan and Shane West as Landon Carter in lead roles. Jamie Sullivan is a precious gem of a woman. Kind, compassionate, and mild, yet sharp, tenacious, and determined. But that’s not all, Jamie is Christian. Sure, she’s the daughter of a Baptist minister, but that’s not what defines her faith. She has her own relationship with God; she's not merely the product of her environment. Meanwhile, Landon Carter is classified as a bad boy. Sullen. Directionless. Unruly. He's got a spark inside of him waiting to be fanned into flame, albeit he's unaware of it yet. Although Jamie breathes on that flame, it is his own spiritual journey that fuels it.</p>

<p>The story starts with Landon being punished for being careless after school and is made to act in the school play. He hesitantly asks Jamie for assistance with his lines. At first, he is reluctant to tell any of his friends that he is hanging out with Jamie, who is far too ordinary to pass for cool. However, this attitude quickly changes. Jamie and Landon are inescapably brought together from their two distinct worlds. As they are forced to spend more and more time together given their circumstances they inevitably fall deeply in love with each other.</p>

<p>This is one of my favourite movies to watch, anytime I am feeling sad and depressed. It is not your average cliche teen romance. I first fell in love with the novel this movie is based on, written by Nicholas Sparks. The chemistry between the actors is natural and not over done, the cinematography and music scores are beautiful. The journey of self-actualization and faith is portrayed so wonderfully, you can see the changes in character development so clearly. The ending, although is sad, you are left with a feeling of fulfillment and satisfaction.</p>
